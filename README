# This set of Ansible scripts builds a Grizzly style Laptop

#
# Change control
#
# Created 2018 0212 Based on Fedora 27
#
#################################################################
#
# Burn DVD and Install Fedora Mate or Upgrade from previous version
# Make sure to create an user with root rights during install
# libvert needs a very lar /var to contain VMs
#
### Prepare the laptop for automation
# 
# SSH doesn't start after a new install
# do this at the laptop:
# sudo systemctl start sshd.service
# sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
#
# Add the deployment account too
# Note: all automated installs and configurations are done by the deploy user
# sudo useradd -m -c 'Deployment User' -G wheel deploy
# sudo passwd deploy
#
# make sure deploy can sudo without a password 
# sudo visudo
# add the line 'deploy  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL'
#
# Add deployment administrators to the deploy group
# usermod -a -G deploy USER
# 
# ON THE BUILD MACHINE
# ssh USER@HOSTNAME
# ssh USER@HOSTNAME.DOMAINNAME
# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub USER@HOSTNAME
# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub deploy@HOSTNAME
# ssh deploy@HOSTNAME
# ssh deploy@HOSTNAME.DOMAINNAME
#
### Get Ansible working
# 
# Make sure the laptop is in the build machine's inventory file
# Let's call the Ansible group 'Fedora'
#
# Ansible ping to make sure everything is working
# ansible Fedora -m ping
### 
#
# The first Automation is to do a system upgrade on the laptop
# 
# This will cause the laptop to reboot and you will need put the key in to boot
# This can take a long while expecially after a fresh install
#
# ansible-playbook ./00-upgrade.yml
#
# Starting lowest number begin automations. They will ocasionally ask a question 
#
# 01 through 09 are neccessary stuff
# Do a 00-upgrade.yml
# 10 through 29 are applications 
# Do a 00-upgrade.yml
# 30 through 39 are Virtual Machine support
#
